# AI-versus-Human-Response-Analysis

# MicroProject Overview

Detecting whether something has been generated by a human or AI can be challenging. This MicroProject delves into this topic by examining 100 identical questions answered by both ChatGPT and a human.

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a company that has developed a platform for natural language processing (NLP) applications. They have created and shared a substantial collection of pre-trained models, datasets, and learning resources, which are open-source and available for the public to use. Using Hello-SampleAI from their HC3 dataset, this MicroProject explores the length of responses, sentiment scores, and subjectivity scores of the responses.

## Data Science Skills

In this microproject, you will explore the Bechdel Test and enhance the following Data Science skills:

- Using string accessor methods of DataFrame data,
- Leveraging the TextBlob library for sentiment, polarity, and subjectivity analysis,
- Utilizing a t-test to test for significance, and
- Working with parallel data (human vs. AI) in a single dataset.
